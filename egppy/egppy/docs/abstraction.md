# Abstraction and Isolation

Erasmus GP has a roadmap of function & optimisation to be implemented. To enable work to start with the most basic function and expand later the objects passed around are abstract, interfaces assumed asynchronous and functions as stateless as possible.

Any and all assumptions are coded into API's as assertions that can be enabled with the logging level.
