# Genetric Code Logical Structure

A genetic codes, GC, is a recursively embedded structure. A GC has an input interface, I, and an output interface, O as well as none or two embedded sub-GCs that are connected together as a graph. The Connection Graph is described in ... A GC with no sub-GCs is called a codon or an empty GC. Codons represent a functional primitive.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Codon GC
    end
```

Any Empty GC is just an interface definition and represents no function.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Empty GC
    end
```

Most GC's are Standard or Conditional which have the same logical structure of 2 sub-GCs identified as A and B. The diagram below shows a GC with GC A and GC B both of which are codons in this case but may be a mixture of any type of GC except an Empty GC.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph GC
        subgraph Codon A
        end
        subgraph Codon B
        end
    end
```

GCs can be infinitely embedded. The diagram below shows a GC with a depth of 5 with the maximum possible number of codons (leaves) which is 32.

The next chart shows a GC of depth 4 with the minimum possible number of codons = 5.

Since codons are the minimum functional unit, which is typically a single operation or line of code, we can state that a GC of depth _n_ has - _n_ < lines of code <= 2ⁿ
