# Default Copilot Instructions

This file contains instructions for GitHub Copilot.

## General

*   Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.
*   Follow Microsoft content policies.
*   Avoid content that violates copyrights.
*   If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
*   Keep your answers short and impersonal.

## Project Overview: Erasmus GP

This is a Python-based Genetic Programming framework named "Erasmus GP". It is structured as a monorepo containing multiple interdependent packages (`egpcommon`, `egpdb`, `egpdbmgr`, `egppy`, `egpseed`). The goal is to emulate evolution to solve problems.

### Architecture

*   The system is modular, with a worker pool (`egppy`) performing evolutionary computations.
*   Genetic data is stored in a PostgreSQL database ("Gene Pool"), managed by `egpdb` and `egpdbmgr`.
*   The project is designed for scalability, with considerations for containerization and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
*   A REST API is provided by `egppkrapi`.

## Coding

*   **Style:** Write clean, well-documented, and idiomatic Python code. Adhere to the coding style enforced by `black` (100-character line length) and `isort`, as configured in the root `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Type Hinting:** Use type hints for all function signatures and variables where appropriate. The project uses `pyright` for static type checking.
*   **Logging:** Use the custom logger from `egpcommon.egp_log` for any new log messages.
*   **Immutability:** The function `sha256_signature` in `egpcommon/egpcommon/common.py` is critical for data integrity and **must not be changed**. Its behavior is fundamental to the entire system.
*   **Dependencies:** Add new dependencies to the appropriate `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` file for the relevant package.
*   **Documentation:** Use docstrings to document all modules, classes, and functions, including in test modules. Follow the existing style in the codebase.

## Testing

*   Ensure the virtual environment /workspaces/erasmus-gp/.venv is activated before running tests.
*   Add unit tests for new features and bug fixes using the `unittest` framework.
*   Place new tests in the repository root `tests` directory within a folder `test_[package name]` reflecting the package source structure beneath e.g. `tests/test_egppy/test_physics/test_psql_types.py`.
*   Ensure that all tests, including the dynamic `test_main_blocks.py`, pass before submitting code.
*   

## Documentation

*   Update the Markdown documentation in the `docs` folder of the relevant package whenever you make changes to the architecture, add features, or modify behavior.
*   Use Mermaid diagrams to illustrate architectural changes where appropriate.

## Commits

*   Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.
