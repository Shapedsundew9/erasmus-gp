# Erasmus Genetic Programming

Erasmus Genetic Programming , Erasmsus GP or just EGP, emulates the principles of natural evolution through a synthetic framework, using functional and physical primitives to create a dynamic and adaptive artificial ecosystem. This approach not only advances our understanding of evolutionary processes but also pushes the boundaries of Artificial Life and Intelligence.

## Evolution: A Synthetic Approach

The process begins with a concept akin to acybergenesis, where the notions of “life” and “intelligence” are not yet relevant.
In nature, life started from a mixture of primordial compounds that, under the influence of heat and light, began to favor the creation of similar compounds. This led to imperfect replication, a cornerstone of evolution. Over time, this imperfect replication, influenced by slowly changing geophysical conditions and more dynamic biological factors, drove the diversity and complexity of life we see today.
Erasmus GP replicates this process in a completely synthetic environment. Here, the primordial compounds are functional primitives like addition, multiplication, and boolean logic. These elements combine and replicate imperfectly, leading to increasingly complex functions. Unlike the natural world, where physical interactions are constrained by molecular complexity, Erasmus GP's replication is governed by a set of physical primitives that define how these functional elements can interact and replicate.
In this synthetic universe, the allocation of resources—CPU power in Erasmus GP, analogous to material and energy in the real world—is proportional to the success of the functional species. Successful functions, measured by their fitness scores for solving specific algorithmic problems, are more likely to replicate. This fitness directly influences the physical primitives' effectiveness, akin to how environmental adaptability influences survival in nature.
Environmental changes, both gradual and sudden, affect the populations within Erasmus GP. Just as in the real world, gradual changes allow for adaptation, while sudden shifts can disrupt once-successful populations. Over time, the problem environment evolves, guiding the system towards complex goals, such as the evolution of the eye / computer vision.
